# Top 400 trance songs (by darktremor)

_These are the rules for posting recommendations. If you break one, I will ignore you. Read them before making a suggestion:

1.If you suggest even one track that is already on the list, I will ignore all other tracks in your suggested list. Use edit/find (on this page), or hit control-f to search out tracks before recommending them. Don't just whip your playlist off into the comments, I want you to make sure it's a)better than some of the tracks on this list, and b)NOT ALREADY ON IT, before you suggest I add it. This list is massive, and the base of tracks it was selected out of is even bigger. I don't mean to be a jerk about it, but I don't have the time to sift through records that are already on the list. Plus, that tells me you didn't think about your suggestion.

2.If you've been listening to trance for less than 9 months, you have a DJ Mystik track on your computer anywhere, or you still (seriously) find tracks by typing "trance" or "techno" into a file sharing program, then please don't suggest anything. Your recommendation is going to be stupid. No, trust me. It is.

3. Don't post "I can't believe [insert probably stupid and derivative track here] isn't on the list! What gives?!?!?" or anything even remotely close to that comment. What gives? If it's really such a masterpiece and it's not on the list, then I probably haven't heard it, dumbass (Or I've heard it, it sucks, and you just have no taste). If you make that comment, I will ignore you. In fact, if you even think about making that comment, don't bother posting, your suggestion is going to be stupid. There are literally millions of trance tracks, and there is no possible way anyone could listen to them all (I've only heard tens of thousands). Although the best tracks tend to bubble up into underground recognition (and no further), there are likely dozens of masterpieces that have gone unnoticed - this is what I'm looking for. However, there are hundreds of thousands of piles of derivative crap that directly steal from classics and never go anywhere. These appeal to newbies who haven't been around long enough to hear the originals (and to E-tards who have no memory of any tracks they've heard at any events), which is why no one who hasn't listened to trance for over 9 months should post here. If you don't know enough about trance to know that more records are released than could ever possibly be listened to, you don't know enough about trance to make an intelligent suggestion, and you're wasting your time.

4. If you have ever, EVER in your life shouted "TIIIIEEEESSSSTTTOOOOO!!!!" or said anything along the lines of "OMG OMG OMG Tiesto is such a God OMG!" don't post here, because you're an idiot. He can play records. Calloo, calay, he belongs on Mount Olympus.

5. Do not write a post stating something like "that's just your opinion! [boring derivative crap] is a masterpiece, you just won't open your ears!" [Stupid derivative crap] is not a masterpiece. You just haven't heard enough trance to know that [stupid derivative crap] doesn't have a shred of originality in it.

6. If you don't like at least five trance tracks produced before 1995, don't bother posting a suggestion, as you know absolutely nothing about trance. Come back when you're older, sonny.

7. If you don't like acid, or don't know what acid is (and weren't knocked out by rule number 2), you're an idiot, don't post.

8. If you don't listen to at least 3 other kinds of electronic music that are not mainstream hip-hop genres or played on the radio, you have no perspective, don't post a suggestion.

_Here's a torrent of the first 50 songs:

here

Many thanks to AsColdAsIce for making this. I'm not sure if it works, but it's worth a shot.

Final note: there are going to be songs on here that aren't perfectly 100% trance. If you see this tag beside a track:

{arguable},

then the track is disputable (or disputed) in some way.

The genres essentially represented are ibiza trance, epic trance, psytrance/goa trance, anthem trance, classic trance, acid trance, ambient trance, tech-trance, and progressive trance. I am liberal with these categories, and what has also ended up on here is some trancier ambient house, acid techno, progressive house, tech-house, "minimal," and breaks. There is a limit, but it's blurry. For example, you won't find funky house, breakbeat hardcore, or aggrotech on here.

[Humate - Love Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) (Paul van Dyk's Love mix) [1993] [Ibiza trance]

It's amazing how little this track loses its loveliness with repeat listens. I've had it for 6 years now, and I still love it just as much as I did when it floored me on the first listen. Even the other top 10 tracks (while still amazing) have diminished in some ways with compulsive listening, but this one remains the shining gem at the top of the trance genre. This perfectly captures the beauty of a tropical sunset on a peaceful deserted island, and to this day never fails to evoke such a scene.

[The Age of Love - Age of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Et0DJ2L8k) (Jam & Spoon's Watch out for Stella mix) [1992] [classic trance]

This is often erroneously called the first trance tune of all time, including by me for a very long time. Well, it wasn't. There was no "first trance tune." It seems to have slowly coalesced out of the Belgian new beat, acid house, techno, and euro-house miasma around at the time. You can look for related tracks in each of these early scenes, but none of them are "trance" per se, they clearly fall into their respective styles. And the first artists who actually set out to make "trance" were mimicking a genre that was already defined. So where do you draw the line? You don't. There was no big bang.

Also, the so-called "original mix" available pretty much everywhere is almost universally actually the (admittedly superior) Jam & Spoon remix. I finally found the real original mixes, and they're not trance at all - they're inarguably new beat. You can almost hear some trance in there, but it's a seed, at best.

That said, this version is a fantastic track, and still one of trance's first. It's beautiful, ethereal, and above all, entrancing.

[Energy 52 - Cafe Del Mar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsig3_e3CXw) (Three N' One mix) [1998] [anthem trance/ibiza trance]

The track that defines everything that an ibiza anthem is, full of all of the excess and bombast of the island: pure dancable joy. The track's central hook is a long, arpeggiated melody looping such that the beginning and end melt together into an endless sphere. It sounds like sped-up 70's minimalism run through a 90's dark trance synth with a sub-tribal feel (it's the beats that do this). I'll admit, the build-up is a little bit cliche by now, but it wasn't really at the time, and for second-wave trance, it's as creative as it's going to get, and more than compensated by the spot-on anthem. In a not so surprising twist, this was initially written by one of the fathers of modern trance (Cosmic Baby), back in 1993 (they were always better at trance than the bedroom nerds and the corporate pop machine). It has gotten another remix every single year since 93, most of which are picked up by trance jocks and many of which go back on the club charts (the best is undoubtedly 1997's chart-topping Three N' One remix (although some prefer the 1998 Nalin & Kane version, and classic trance addicts will love the original)).

[Future Sound of London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAvHjoLxxh8) - Papua New Guinea [1991] [ambient trance/classic trance]

Released in 1991, this song wasn't even intended to be trance - no one even used the word yet (although there was a fledgling sound growing in the underground house, rave, and techno scenes). It was meant to be ambient breaks, but "Papua New Guinea's" atmosphere was like little other electronic dance released at the time - ethereal, spacy, almost angelic, but still dancefloor-worthy, catchy, and even relaxing. The song instantly became a trance classic once the genre was brought into official existence in 1993, and deservingly so. Like it's predecessor "Age of Love," even today it can be played without sounding the slightest bit dated.

{arguable - ambient breaks}

[Underworld - Born Slippy (NUXX)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQwg2JJFm6A) [1995] [classic trance/hard trance]

**worth mentioning [Original 1995 Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fr1x-N3-k8) ~ passmesomesugar

A melodic trance tune with stream-of-consciousness lyrics that become stranger with each listen, mainly beacuse they never really had any actual internal logic to begin with. The melody is unforgettably catchy, and contains a nice twist in the middle, in which it goes from being a wistful and pretty little ambient trancer, to a hard and abrasive swedish techno stormer, and pulls both off better than just about anything in either genre. Surprisingly, especially with this being, you know, actually good, this was a huge hit in Europe (it went to number 2 on the world chart in 1996-97), and gets at least two new remixes every year, at least one of which always goes back on the club charts (hopefully 2006 will be an exception? Honestly, they're never going to top the original). So, not only is it one of the best, it's also the most popular to still retain credibility.

{arguable - melodic techo(?)}

[Sasha - Xpander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Gu7CXfRdA) [1999] [progressive trance]

Perfect progressive trance. A melody that, like the last 2 tracks, is atmospheric, loops on itself, and endlessly contagious, without seeming repetitive. This song is absorbing - the feeling throughout is impossible to describe, since like I said before...dancing about architecture. Just download the track. It's incredible. (Was another mega-European hit. I don't know the details specifically, but it doesn't matter).

[Nalin & Kane - Beachball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28wwqbyRBNQ) [1996] [ibiza trance]

Gorgeous, elegant, and never tiring. It's quite possible that I've listened to this track more times than any other, probably my personal favorite. Built out of tribal, yet melodic beats (the "Nalin and Kane sound"), relaxing and inobtrusive vocals, and a slow, subtle build that takes its time to breakdown. When it does breakdown, air strings and seagulls wash and flow around each other as if musically taking flight to a Mediterannean sky over a sunset-golden beach. When the breakdown ends, "Becahball" slowly floats back to earth, before spending the remainder of the track rippling back and forth between the sky and the sand.

{arguable - ibiza house}

[Paragliders - Paraglide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c48baEsPM4Y) [1993] [classic trance]

[DnTel - (This is) The Dream of Evan and Chan (Superpitcher Kompakt remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PVorE74HfA) [2002] [minimal trance]

This is probably the only trance track ever created with vocals worth listening to. But it doesn't rest on them, just allowing them to sparsely resonant in a minimal nothing, it raises them, gently bringing them to soaring heights with gorgeous melodies that slowly drown out the surreal beauty of the evocative lyrics. Eventually the glistening bells overtake the words entirely, taking the already flying track into the stratosphere. It's the perfect representative of minimal trance.

{arguble: tech-house/progressive house/microhouse}

[Hardfloor - Acperience 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un4CeV_l3pI) [1992] [acid trance/classic trance]

{arguable - acid}

[Hybrid - Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA03Z7p5O-8) [1997] [orchestral trance]

Wow. Forget Adagio for Strings, forget Protect Your Mind, forget ****ing Airwave, symphonic trance was created and destroyed with this track. Everything trance is supposed to make you feel, and almost everything classical is supposed to do can be found here in this amazing song. Easy to dance to, creative beats (breaktrance, so they actually put some thought into them), more melodies than you can possibly count, and all this without sounding crowded or overstuffed; all of it original. They even did it without overusing the breakdown. Fantastic, it completly lives up to its title.

[Aphex Twin - Didgeridoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BGTvxxKoHM) [1992] [acid trance]

This track is simultaneously hard, twisted and beautiful, which is something I would have considered a nearly impossible feat until I heard this, and despite being over 15 years old, it still sounds innovative and fresh today. Built on a foundation of Basic Channel-esque foggy acid lines, Didgeridoo manages to build and break like trance, while meandering and wandering like ambient and relentlessly pounding and squiggling like acid techno without sounding forced or mashed together. A didgeridoo sets the bassline resulting in a simultaneously relaxing, funky and dark atmosphere. It can sound like a trance anthem, a techno monster, or an ambient chilldown depending on how you listen, and it's all of those together and more, and it grows greater with each listen. Didgeridoo is undoubtedly one of the greatest trance tracks of all time. Whether or not it's in the genre of "trance" per se is questionable (though a connecting thread is certainly there), but in the most elastic sense of entrancing dance music, it comes out pretty close to the top.

{arguable - ambient acid techno(?)}

[Orbital - Halcyon On & On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV-hSgL1R74) [1993] [ambient trance]

{arguable - ambient techno}

{arguable - progressive house}

[LSG - Hearts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RzfWRgue7M) [1994] [classic trance/acid trance]

[Dance 2 Trance - We Came in Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnR_A_zQ3bU) [1990] [classic trance]

Another contender for first trance song ever created. Whether this track came first, or Age of Love is questionable, but the quality of this little masterpiece is indisputable. Almost like minimal goa, mixed with James Holden-esque progressive (but of course, it predates all of that). It's reminiscent of being on the moon, or on the surface of an alien world: exactly the way trance should sound.

[Underworld - Dark Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brZ_WBEzw6E) [1994] [classic trance]

[Infected Mushroom - Mush Mushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZB7ApwMn6w) [goa trance/psytrance]

[Datura - Yerba Del Diablo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji4wKvlHRMw) [1992] [classic trance/acid trance]

{I find it's a lot like psytrance/goa trance, but this isn't a bad thing.}

[Three Drives - Greece 2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cXMnZ2vrx8) [1997] [progressive trance/anthem trance]

[PHD - Summer Storm (Leisure Lounge Edit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arCCNThPwaA) [1994] [classic trance/acid trance]

[Jam and Spoon - Stella [1992]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLy--cFj6W0) [ibiza trance]

[Hallucinogen - LSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsVzSMRw8E) [1994] [psytrance/goa trance]

[Commander Tom - Are Am Eye?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh6wrLwRUt8) [1995] [classic trance/dark trance(?)]

{arguable - rave}

Phobia - Phobia (DJ Hell mix) [1991/2007] [classic trance/acid trance]

What actually makes the DJ Hell 2007 mix different from the 1991 original is pretty minimal (ha. ha. no.), but it seems to do the trick, elevating what was already a trance classic into the neo-trance masterpiece it was always meant to be. Really though, everything that made the track so incredible to begin with is there, and everything added on could have been created back in 1991. But it rounds it out perfectly.

It's rather dark trance. The anchoring melody is simply a two note depth charge interspersed with a transmission-like voice ("let me have silence") and a strangely affecting diva wail, held down by a circular acid line that eventually dissolves into quasi-anthemic territory (a la Acid Eiffel, which it actually transcends). Everything here is simple and effective, and reminiscent of floating in space past a rocky wasteland moon, no power in the ship, unable to navigate, fleeing alien depth charges. Or perhaps it's like being under the ocean on an alien planet in almost complete blackness and silence but for the occasional bursts of extraterrestrial explosives seeking to destroy your submarine, hidden in the deep, the power.

This is also a flagpost of what seems to be a classic trance revival of sorts brought about by an adoring minimal community (some of whom floated out of classic trance-land in the first place, fleeing the epic anthem boom of the late 90s. You know who I mean. Sven Vath. Stephan Bodzin.)

Etnica - Moon Influence [1996] [goa trance/psytrance]

Yahel - Voyage [2000] [psytrance/epic trance]

Binary Finary - 1998 [1998] [anthem trance]

Note: 1999 and 2000 are the same track, re-released for more guiltless radioplay and club spinning. Although why this odd norm exists at all is beyond me. If you still like the track, just keep playing it. Don't buy it again with a different date stamped on the cover, just so you can label yourself "upfront."

Union Jack - Red Herring [1995] [acid trance]

Beanfield - Tides (Carl Craig mix) [2004] [minimal trance/neo-trance]

Cybordelics - Adventures of Dama [1993] [classic trance]

DJ Tiesto - Suburban Train [2001] [epic trance]

James Holden - Nothing (93 Returning mix) [2003] [progressive trance]

Roland Appel - Dark Soldier [2007] [minimal trance/neo-trance]

Efdemin - Lohn & Brot [2007] [minimal trance/neo-trance]

"Minimal" has gotten so trancy this year that almost all of the best new tracks warrant (high) places on this list.

This is the only trance track on the entire list that I fell in love with during the opening bar (Those first three notes are actually truly beautiful, and even if the track didn't go anywhere from there it would still warrant a place somewhere on this list as the best filler of all time). I don't even cut this track up in my iPod playlist.

{arguable - minimal. But argue with me that it's really minimal and not trance at all and I'll actually beat you down. I will find out where you live, and I will beat you down. It's got breakdowns, dammit, BREAKDOWNS. Yeah, minimal. Right.}

Allure - When She Left [1998] [epic trance]

This is a lost treasure - many of you will have never heard of this. An earlier Tiesto track, but it's epic, melodic, gorgeous, and everything Tiesto wishes he could now do. If a bit too fluffy.

Darude - Sandstorm [1999] [anthem trance]

This track is not a sellout, and it deserves much of the popular support it got. There is not one element to this track that panders to the masses any more than the rest of the anthem trance. I'll admit, there are better tunes that should also be imported to the mainstream, but this track is still pretty good.

_Note: "Not trance at all, but excellent tracks" removals:

The Orb - Little Fluffy Clouds [1991] [ambient trance]

This is ambient house, and not even slightly definable as trance. I foolishly left it on the list for so long that I didn't want to remove it. I was quite foolish.).

This is one of only 3 ambient anything tracks to ever reach the top 40 charts (correct me if I'm wrong on this one). It was a runaway hit when released in 1990 (although I don't know if it ever reached North America), Little Fluffy Clouds was another major influence on the formation of the trance genre. Catchy melodies, ambient synths, and an interesting vocal sample, combined with the trademark Orb atmosphere make this another incredible classic.

808 State - Pacific State [1989] (it's actually house)

Orbital - Chime [1990] (rave)

Layo & Bushwacka! - Love Story [2002] (progressive house)

Ulrich Schnauss - Kneuddelmaus (very melodic IDM)

Force Legato - System [1989] (EBM)

DJ Hooligan - Hear You Now [2002] (Note: I had this track confused with Starecase - Faith (Loafer mix) for 4 years, and only discovered it today. I heard the actual track. I don't really like it. Besides, it's not even close to being trance. More like ambient pop, the sort of thing I always imagined when I heard the term [the actual genre sounds nothing like this, it's really just ambient/chillout with yet another flashy title] )

Cass & Mangan - Green Eggs [2005] (progressive house/tech-house)

Felix da Housecat - Watching Cars Go By (electro-house/electroclash)

Orbital - One Perfect Sunrise

Ian Van Dahl - Castles in the Sky

P.O.S. - Remember [2003]

Paul Van Dyk - Forbidden Fruit

The Horrorist - One Night in New York City (it's seriously just techno)

Sander Kleinenberg - The Fruit [2004] (Electro-house, inarguably)

Dark Suite - Dark Sweet Piano (Wally Lopez mix) (not trance at all)

Recent Removals: [derivative, cheesy, annoying, undanceable, and/or undeniable not trance/entrancing, it all goes in here]

Pulp Victim - The World [1998]

Delerium ft Sarah Machlachlan - Silence (Tiesto mix) [2000]

{arguable - electro-house}

Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone [1998]

Planet Perfecto - Bullet in the Gun

Ferry Corsten - Rock Your Body Rock [2003]

DJ Shog - Another World {Quite possibly one of the worst producer names of all time. Besides the fact that putting "DJ" before your alias is ****ing idiotic, "Shog" is probably the stupidest slang term ever invented. Totally inappropriate too, considering it's an ebonic word: this is about the equivalent of a trance artist named DJ Murda-Thug. Only "shog" has no street cred as a colloquialism (ie: only wiggers say it), so it's like calling yourself DJ Fuzzy Street Soldja, playing fluffy trance, and thinking you're pretty hardcore. The track is also terrible.)

Aquagen - Summer is Calling

Blind's list

For another alternate opinion on the best trance music, check out: TranceAddict's list. His ideas are very different from mine, I don't agree with quite a few of his top tracks, but if he thought exactly what I did, what would the point be of making a list? Worth checking out.
